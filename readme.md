##Hailey Framework Beta====================used and designed by lambda-code.com---------------------This is a very tiny mvc framework within all needingsto design large website up to complex searchengines andsocial networks with ease.### What is it?####SimpleHAILEY is an very small library and framework for your projects. It does no matter how big or how small your projectwill be.####Downgrade compatibilityFell free to make new functions or classes, but in this master it's not alowed to delete old functionsor change there returns and goal. So we make sure, that everyone can update his project with the new core file withoutfear to get a real hard night.####MinimalistOnly the real needed essentials are here. Non-MVC related functionality are not provided yet.####RobustCore code is very small and can be audited and secured quickly, also by beginners. It's a good place to start from here.SQL injection would be unable by protection with PDO.####UnobtrusiveNo restrictions on use of other libraries like PEAR or another ORM like Doctrine.All PHP globals are accessible.####FlexiblePDO abstraction allows choice of databases.Core MVC classes can be extended or overriden easily using object oriented inheritance.Choice of using procedural or object-oriented code or both! This was a real hard decision and i'm sure,that many hardcore coders want me dead by now :)####FastNo feature, code or framework bloat at all.Even faster when used with a PHP Accelerator like APC.####Friendly URLIt uses Human/Robot friendly URLs.Also upgrade friendly, simply overwrite of the old core file with the new one!### Little help guide####The Model ORM CLASSHAILEY provides a "Model" ORM class to let you map your database tables as PHP objects. It requires PHP5.Data objects extend the Model class and have five functions: Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete and Exists.Let's start with a little "users" table, with the following fields: uid (autoincremented primary key)usernamepassword fullname created_dateNow let's build a Model. By the Way - this is not a tutorial for save Logins. Don't use it, for real Projects.```php	<?php	class User extends H_Model {	function User() {	//call parent with primary key name "uid", table name "users"	//and function that returns the pdo handler named "getdbh"	parent::__construct('uid','users','getdbh');	//list of table fields below, need not contain all fields in table.	$this->rs['uid'] = '';	$this->rs['username'] = '';	$this->rs['password'] = '';	$this->rs['fullname'] = '';	$this->rs['created_dt'] = '';	}}?>```If you are an real lazy coder.HAILEY can create the object for you. The only thing you need is the name of the table.```php	<?php	class User extends H_Model {	function User() {	//call parent with primary key name "uid", table name "users"	//and function that returns the pdo handler named "getdbh"	parent::__construct('uid','users','getdbh');	//list of table fields below, need not contain all fields in table.	$this->rs['uid'] = '';	$this->rs['username'] = '';	$this->rs['password'] = '';	$this->rs['fullname'] = '';	$this->rs['created_dt'] = '';	}}?>```For the Model to work, a global function that returns the PDO needs to be defined.In this case we got an table called User:```php<?php                    $dbm = new H_DBM();                    $dbm->createModel('User');                    $user = new User();                    $user_array = $user->retrieve_many();?>```I think this is an really lazy-mode.Here a few snippets to se how the Model works```php//Create$user = new User();$user->set('username','user');$user->set('password','password');$user->create();$uid=$user->get('uid');//Update$user->set('password','newpassword');$user->update();//Retrieve, Delete, Exists$user = new User();$user->retrieve($uid);if ($user->exists())	$user->delete();//Retrieve based on other criteria than the PK$user = new User();$user->retrieve_one("username=?",'yetanotherusr');$user->retrieve_one("username=? AND password=? AND status='enabled'",array('erickoh','123456'));//Return an array of Model objects$user = new User();$user_array = $user->retrieve_many("username LIKE ?",'eric%');foreach ($user_array as $user)	$user->delete();//Return selected fields as array$user = new User();$result_array = $user->select("username,email","username LIKE ?",'eric%');print_r($result_array);```#### Controller ClassIn HAILEY, the Controller looks at the HTTP Request and then route the program control to the appropriate function.It allows the use of Search Engine Friendly URLs on your web application.> For the Controller to work, mod_rewrite is required and has to be configured via the webserver config file or via an .htaccess file.How it works:Parse the HTTP Request URLIncludes a php file based on (1)Calls a php function included from (2)Some examples:http://mydomain.com/example-controller/action/param1/param2With the above URL, it includes a file example-controller/action.php and calls the function _action(param1,param2)http://mydomain.com/example-controller2/action2With the above URL, it includes a file example-controller2/action2.php and calls the function _action2()http://mydomain.com/example-controller2/action2/With the above URL, it includes a file example-controller2/action2.php and calls the function _action2('')http://mydomain.com/example-controller/action/param1/?a=1&b=2With the above URL, it includes a file example-controller/action.php and calls the function _action(param1,'?a=1&b=2')The querystring works and the global variable $_GET = array('a'=>1, 'b'=>2). Your function does not have to define the second parameter.This is how the Controller is called:```php$controller = new H_Controller('../app/controllers/','/','main','index'); $controller->parse_http_request()->route_request();```#### View ClassThe templates are plain PHP files, and so normal PHP code can be used and the PHP global variables are accessible together with any extra variables you have passed in as a parameter in the form of an associative array.Let's say you have a template file named welcome.tpl.php with the following contents:```php<html>  <head>    <title><?php echo $pagename;?></title>  </head>  <body>    <h1>Welcome <?php echo $username;?>,</h1>    <p>The time is now <?php echo date("Y-m-d H:i:s");?></p>  </body></html>```This is how you use call template file using a simple function call:```php<?php	$vars = array("pagename"="Welcome!","username"="yetanotherusr");	echo View::do_fetch("/path/to/welcome.tpl.php",$vars);?>```Same result as above, but using object-oriented code:```php<?php	$vars = array("pagename"="Welcome!","username"="yetanotherusr");	$view = new H_View("/path/to/welcome.tpl.php",$vars);	echo $view->fetch();?>```Annnnd another way, a little bit easier for beginners```php<?php	$view = new H_View("/path/to/welcome.tpl.php");	$view->set("pagename","Welcome!");	$view->set("username","Eric");	echo $view->fetch();?>```####Other ORMThe ORM class is not related to the View-Controller, so you can replace it with another ORM Classes even CouchDB, MongoDB or even POSTgreSQL.
